### Confusion

> Ragnarok Online Fact Of The Day: If a confusion attack hits a confused target, the target will no longer be confused. This was mistakenly interpreted as "removed on damage" before, but the truth is, if you confuse a target (you hear a sound) and then switch your weapon to a weapon that does not cause confusion, then it will not be removed on damage and the target remains confused for the whole duration.
