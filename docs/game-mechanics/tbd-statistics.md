This document describes how Ragnarok Online's zone servers make use of character statistics.

## Statistics

TODO Table, description

* ``STR`` (Strength)
* ``INT`` (Intelligence)
* ``DEX`` (Dexterity)
* ``AGI`` (Agility)
* ``VIT`` (Vitality)
* ``LUK`` (Luck)

### TBD

> Fun fact of day: INT and VIT from equip actually give you +1 HP/SP additionally. So for example if your base SP is 300, then you usually get +3 SP per INT. But if you get 1 INT from an equip, you actually get +4 SP.
